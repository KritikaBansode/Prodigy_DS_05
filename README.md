# Analyzing Traffic Accident Data to Identify Patterns

This Project is done under Prodigy InfoTech. It includes analysis of traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day, and visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors. The dataset provided from Kaggle contains extensive information on US traffic accidents.
